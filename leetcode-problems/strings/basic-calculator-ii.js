/* Given a string s which represents an expression, evaluate this expression and
return its value.

The integer division should truncate toward zero.

Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings
as mathematical expressions, such as eval().

Example 1:

Input: s = "3+2*2" Output: 7 Example 2:

Input: s = " 3/2 " Output: 1 Example 3:

Input: s = " 3+5 / 2 " Output: 5

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 3 * 105 s consists of integers and operators ('+', '-', '*',
'/') separated by some number of spaces.  s represents a valid expression.  All
the integers in the expression are non-negative integers in the range [0, 231 -
1].  The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
