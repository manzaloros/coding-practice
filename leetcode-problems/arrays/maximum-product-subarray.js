    The idea with this algo is you form every subarray from left to right and
    right to left, updating max each time. Always start the running product at
    1, since you are multiplying each time. If your running product is a 0, it
    will ruin the rest of your results, so just ignore it by resetting the
    running product to 1, pretending that you started a new subarray at that
    point.

    Very similar to the "product except self" problem!
